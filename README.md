# Ethereum Dapp for Tracking Items through Supply Chain

This repository contains an Ethereum Dapp that demonstrates how to track items through a supply chain.

## Project Requirements

### Architecture

- [ ] General write up e.g. steps and contracts address
- [ ] Project write-up - UML
  - [ ] Activity
  - [ ] Sequence
  - [ ] State
  - [ ] Classes (Data Model)
- [ ] Project write-up - Libraries
- [ ] Project write-up - IPFS

### Smart contracts requirements

- [ ] SupplyChain.sol contains required tracking functions.
- [ ] Ownable.sol contains required functions that establish owner and the transfer of ownership.
- [ ] ConsumerRole.sol contains required functions that manage the consumer role.
- [ ] RetailerRole.sol contains required functions that manage the consumer role.
- [ ] DistributorRole.sol contains required functions that manage the consumer role.
- [ ] Additional roles implemented are integrated correctly.

### Testing

- [ ] Tests for smart contract functions are written using Chai assertions.
- [ ] All tests pass.

### Deploy smart contract on a public test network

- [ ] Contract is deployed on the Goerli testnet.
- [ ] Contract address and transaction hash are documented.

### Frontend

- [ ] Frontend is implemented using web3.js to interact with the smart contracts.
- [ ]Â Use Cases: Submit a product for shipment, receive product from shipment, validate the authenticity of the product.
